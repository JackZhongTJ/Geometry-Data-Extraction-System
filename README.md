Hi, it's my first github repository.  
It's been such a long time i use the github since i starts learning programming. I'll keep it and post my learning progress of my graduate life.

## Geometry-Data-Extraction-System

###Here's my bachelor graduation project;
The system is aiming for the extraction and downloading of geometry data by selecting bound and filter the geometry attributes.  
* User can type in the place and the web page will jump to the corresponding point. After that, user selects an area and filter the attribute of the geometry data in the bound. Click the download button and the system will starts downloading. 
* The geometry data is sourced from OpenStreetMap, and the server client is based on php, database is pgsql, front-end is Http, javascript.
